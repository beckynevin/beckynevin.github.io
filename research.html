  <p><b>Galaxy Evolution</b> 
    This field of astronomy is really exciting because we are still looking for answers. While we know that galaxies grow and evolve over time, it is not totally clear which processes are driving different types of evolution. 
  <p>
I approach this problem from a unique perspective that joins simulations of galaxy mergers with observations. I work with Laura Blecha at the University of Florida to create a beautiful simulation suite of merging galaxies using the SUNRISE simulations. From these simulations, I create mock observations to match [insert your favorite galaxy survey], and from these mock images and kinematic maps, I have developed a galaxy merger classification tool that learns to classify galaxies as various types of mergers. 

<p> 
I am currently developing this tool for use on the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, which is an optical survey of 10,000 galaxies. They call it the survey for people who love galaxies for a reason! With this large statistical sample of galaxies, I plan to create samples of real galaxies in different stages of merging in order to build a more cohesive picture about if, when, and how galaxy mergers drive galaxy evolution.
  <p> Below, I am showing some mock observations (imaging and stellar kinematics) that I have created from the SUNRISE simulated galaxy merger. The machine learning classification tool relies upon parametric and non-parametric 'predictors', which I extract from the images and kinematic maps of the merger to assign a given galaxy a probability of being in a merger.

  <p><b>Active Galactic Nuclei</b> 

    Supermassive black holes are one of the biggest paradoxes in the universe - not only are they one of the darkest places, but the region around them can shine bright as a quasar. Supermassive black holes that are actively accreting gas, which powers this energetic phenomenon across the electromagnetic spectrum, are known as active galactic nuclei, or AGN.
  <p>
 I focus on the kinematics of AGN, focusing on the powerful biconical outflows they can drive from their central regions. These outflows have the potential to impact their host galaxies (SMBHs live in the centers of galaxies), so I focus on modeling their energetics using an analytical MCMC approach. This technique has the advantage of providing a posterior probability of the parameters of the bicone, meaning that I can constrain both the geometry and the energetics of these AGN-driven outflows based on their optical emission lines.

<p>
I have measured the energetics of 18 AGN-driven outflows and I find that 

<p>
I also spend a good amount of time fitting Gaussians to kinematics.

<p><b>Case Studies of Fascinating Galaxies</b>
  Sometimes I like to work with individual galaxies. These objects are really interesting for a number of reasons; many of them have complicated interconnections between AGN-driven outflows and star formation.

<p> For instance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00825">'J1354' is interesting because it has an example of an AGN turning on and off, powering an outflow first in the south and then one in the north.</a>

<p> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0033-2"> NGC6240 has it all.</a> It is a confirmed dual AGN and also hosts a star-formation driven outflow in addition to an AGN-driven outflow. The energy budget of both are required to shut down star formation.

  <p><b>Machine Learning with Astronomy</b> 
  As data gets larger and more sophisticated, it is increasingly important to pay attention to the techniques used to carry out the scientific analysis. It is truly a curse of too much data at times, and some of the aspects of the data often go unused just because the data is unwieldly, or it is initially difficult to visualize. I enjoy thinking about novel ways to get more bang for our buck. I particularly like to harness various machine learning techniques to do science, which often involves developing tools that push machine learning to become more scientific (i.e., with error analysis built in or with in depth discussion of the physical implications of the results)
